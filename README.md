The second rewrite of my original Shop APPrentice app, this time I am integrating the state management library redux. It has been an excellent learning expereience to see how much my code has changed since I started learning just a few months ago. This has been, by far, the biggest challenge so far and I'm not ashamed to say that redux really gave me some tough issues to solve but I finally got all of the code rewritten and working as intended. This repo will be used to add a back-end and database to my app and turn it into a full-stack project.
